        <h1>Fire Detection Cube Sat</h1>
        <div class="project-detail-image" style="background: url('assets/Cubesat.jpeg') center/cover;"></div>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            I designed a CubeSat meant to detect fire using computer vision, take photos, and send data to a ground
            station to aid first responders. This was made during the outbreak of fires in California and around the
            world.

            <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The project focused on creating a 1U CubeSat capable of identifying the location and size of fires. It
                autonomously processes imagery to filter out non-relevant data before transmission to save bandwidth and
                power.

            <h2>2. Objective</h2>
            <p>
                We wanted to make a 1U CubeSat that could report needed information about fires to aid humanitarian
                efforts.

            <h2>3. Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                We used a Raspberry Pi as the motherboard and added a photo module. We coded the satellite to take
                photos periodically, ensuring full coverage of the earth through its orbit. It includes logic to
                identify areas of fire and delete images not containing fire, sleeping while not taking photos to save
                battery. A solar panel was added to recharge the battery.

            <h2>4. Results & Outcome</h2>
            <p>
                We won "Best Presentation" in the challenge we submitted it to. The system successfully demonstrated the
                concept of autonomous fire detection from orbit.

            <h2>5. Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to expand this into a 2U or bigger Sat so that it could improve universal access to
                satellite imagery to aid humanitarian efforts.
