        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            I made a motor that I fully 3D modeled and 3D printed, and wound the stator myself designing the WYE magnet
            design.

            <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project involved creating a functional electric motor from scratch using 3D printing technologies.
                I handled everything from the mechanical design in Fusion 360 to the electrical winding of the stator.

            <h2>2. Objective</h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to build a motor that I would potentially use in a future drone build.

            <h2>3. Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                I used Fusion 360 to model it and started by laying out the goals for KV and torque, letting that
                influence the choices I made when it came to winding and layout. Choosing to use an ESC also changed my
                design decisions.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Results & Outcome</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to make it work; it runs and can be used. I haven't added a prop to it yet to test it for
                flight, but the core mechanism is functional.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to machine one in the future instead of using 3D printed parts so that it is stronger and
                improves efficiency. I also want to try making an axial motor.
