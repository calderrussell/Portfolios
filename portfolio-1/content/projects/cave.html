        <h1>Cave Lab App</h1>
        <div class="project-detail-image">

        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            I made an app to test out some new ideas about enabling cross-session state sharing because the current
            framework did not allow for that. I decided to make an app that would keep track of every country you have
            been to on an interactive map and give you points based on the countries.
        </p>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The shared data aim of this project was being able to view other people's maps and have a global
                leaderboard. MIT’s CAVE Lab framework provides modular building blocks for immersive data visualization,
                and this app served as a testbed for extending those capabilities.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>2. Objective</h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to extend the framework to make it applicable to even more things, specifically enabling
                cross-session state sharing which was a limitation in the existing system.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>3. Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                I used Django for integrating the backend as that was what all the code was already written in. The
                frontend interacts with JSON data to manage state.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>4. Results & Outcome</h2>
            <p>
                It was mostly a success. I was able to implement the leaderboard functionality effectively. However,
                during my time with MIT, I was not able to fully implement the feature for viewing other people’s maps.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>5. Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to fully flesh out the idea and apply it to other current apps that they have in production
                to support companies using the CAVE Lab framework.
