        <h1>Markov Chain Word Generation</h1>
        <div class="project-detail-image" style="background: url('assets/LLM.jpg') center/cover;"></div>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            After I learned about Markov chains in Probability, I decided I wanted to make a word generator that was
            trained off of all of Brandon Sanderson's collective works.

            <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project focuses on statistical text generation. By analyzing the frequency of character and word
                transitions in a large corpus of text, the model builds a probabilistic graph to generate new,
                similar-sounding text.
            </p>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>2. Objective</h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to better understand Markov chains and the technology that can predict words for us while
                typing (a potential use of this project).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>3. Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                Written in Python using all hard-coded math (no high-level ML libraries, mostly NumPy). It was all done
                using dictionaries of the connections between letters and strings of letters, effectively building a
                graph of transition probabilities.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Results & Outcome</h2>
            <p>
                It worked! Given a seed, it is able to generate a story that, while not meaning much semantically, is
                remarkably like Brandon Sanderson's writing style, with character mentions and syntactically correct
                sentences.

            <h2>5. Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                I think this is as far as I can get before just making an LLM using tokenization and attention
                mechanisms.
